# Dataset Preparation


## UCF-101

The UCF-101 dataset can be downloaded from [dataset provider](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php).

The train.csv and val.csv files for this dataset are already prepared by me. However, the UCF-101 folder must be placed
in the main SlowFast folder. If usage of another path/dataset is required, csv files should be prepared with such format:

```
path_to_video_1 label_1
path_to_video_2 label_2
path_to_video_3 label_3
...
path_to_video_N label_N
```
